- **Knowledge Quiz (`quiz.html`)** – Ten-question quiz that reinforces key takeaways.
- **Ayurvedic Home Remedies (`ayurvedic-remedies.html`)** – Newly added page featuring kitchen-friendly tips for colds, coughs, low-grade fevers, sore throats, minor cuts, pimples, and other mild discomforts, complete with attribution-safe images.

## Getting started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Serve the project over HTTP/HTTPS (for example run `npx serve .` or VS Code Live Server). Browsers block `.glb` files when opened from the `file://` protocol, so a local server is required for the 3D plants to appear.
3. For best visuals, keep the `models`, `images`, `scripts`, and `styles` folders in the same directory as the HTML files.

### Optional tooling

If you prefer using a dev server, you can launch one with any static-server CLI (e.g., `npx serve .`). This is optional; the project works as plain HTML.
